```{r setup, include=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## STEP 5: No merge conflicts!

```{r partner 1}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a plot of price vs. carat (or some other
### variables of your choice)
diamonds_plot <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) 
  

```

```{r partner 2}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a subset based on filtering, e.g., 
### size greater than 1 carat or cut is "Ideal"


### Hi Narjes!
subset <- diamonds %>%
  filter(carat > 1 & cut == "Ideal")
```

## STEP 7: Uh oh, merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-1}

### Hi Narjes!  here's my code

code <- 1 + 2

```

## STEP 11: And even more merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-2}
### Both partners - delete this comment, then write some code here
### to plot, summarize, calculate something simple using the diamonds
### dataset.


```
